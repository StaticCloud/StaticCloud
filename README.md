## About Me

I am a early-career software engineer with a passion for solving business problems and bringing ambitious ideas to life.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering in 2024, and I currently work as a software development instructional specialist at edX. My responsibilities include teaching students various software development technologies and concepts, troubleshooting and debugging full-stack applications, and reviewing code with best practices for code structure and clarity in mind.

I have experience working with C#, ASP.NET, TypeScript, Express, React, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Docker, and various AWS services. I am driven by a desire to solve complex business problems by leveraging my existing skill set, and building valuable products.
